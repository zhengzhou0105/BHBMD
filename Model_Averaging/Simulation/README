# Evaluate the performance of model averaging approaches
# Using simulated meta-dose-response data
# To account for uncertainty in data simulation and result dependency on the idiosyncracy on a specific data simulation
# Integrate a iterative process in data simulation
# Variation introduced through probabilistic distribution in the simulational parameters of the following variables:
# Dose, Response, Number of test subjects
# Iterative results were aggregated for a probabilistic evaluation of performance
