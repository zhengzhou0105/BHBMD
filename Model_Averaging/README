Evaluate the performance of model averaging performance in hierarchical bayesian benchmark dose modeling
Able to handle uncertainties from metadata and model selection simultaneously
    Metadata uncertainty- hierarchical structure
    Model selection- various model averaging approaches: 
        # Akaike Information Criteria
        # Bayesian Model Averaging (Approximated by Bayeisian Information Criteria)
        # Logarithm of Pseudo Marginal Likelihood
        # Widely Applicable Information Criteria
        # Stacking
        # Pseudo Bayesian Model Averaging
        # Pseudo Bayesian Model Averaging with Bootstrapping
Averaging Performance evaluted by: root squared mean error, absolute mean error and relative deviance
