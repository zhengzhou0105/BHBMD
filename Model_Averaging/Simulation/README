Evaluate the performance of model averaging approaches
Using simulated meta-dose-response data
To account for uncertainty in data simulation and result dependency on the idiosyncracy on a specific data simulation
Integrate a iterative process in data simulation
Variation introduced through probabilistic distribution in the simulational parameters of the following variables:
Dose, Response, Number of test subjects
Iterative results were aggregated for a probabilistic evaluation of performance

The suffix of script denotes the true model from which the data were simulated. For example, in MAS_Linear.R data were simulated with Linear model E(Y)= a+bX as the true model.
